# Lucky numbers for 4D and Toto

A simple Python program to generate random 4 digits number and 6 two-digits number.

The digits are randonly generated from 0 to 9 and combine together. This is to ensure an equal distribution of numbers instead of generating 0 to 9999.

For Toto, numbers `00` is not available. Thus checks are done that when that sequence happens, the numbers are re-generated.

Finally the display is human-readable. `[] , " "` are striped.
